Jeffrey Wooldridge [tells his students](https://twitter.com/causalinf/status/1259448663270658050) that most of econometrics is just ten statistical theorems applied over and over. As a political scientist with applied statistics training, the list caught my attention because it contained so many of the theorems used in proofs I typically glaze over when reading academic papers. His complete list (slightly paraphrased) is:

1. Law of Iterated Expectations, Law of Total Variance
2. Linearity of Expectations, Variance of a Sum
3. Jensen's Inequality, Chebyshev's Inequality
4. Linear Projection and its Properties
5. Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem
6. Slutsky's Theorem, Continuous Convergence Theorem, Asymptotic Equivalence Lemma
7. Big Op, Little op, and the algebra of them
8. Delta Method
9. Frisch-Waugh Partialling Out
10. For PD matrices A and B, A-B is PSD if and only if $B^{-1} - A^{-1}$ is PSD.

This list (which sneaks in a few more then ten proofs) contains concepts that I had some handy-wavey idea about, some that I see constantly in my readings and willfully ignore, and others I hadn't come across before. 

As an exercise in improving my own knowledge of these fundamentals, I decided to work through each theorem -- collating notes from material available online, as well as excellent books like Aronow & Miller's [-@aronow2019foundations] *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*, Angrist and Pischke's [-@angrist2008mostly] *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*, and Wasserman's [-@WassermanAllStatisticsConcise2004] *All of Statistics*.

I often found for a list of important theorems there were few consistent sources that contained explanations *and* proofs of each. Often, textbooks had excellent descriptive intuitions but would hold back on offering full, annotated proofs. Or full proofs without explaining the wider significance of the theorems. Or the theorem was briefly stated to be used in some other proof. Some of the concepts, moreover, had different definitions dependent on the field or source of the proof (like Slutsky's Theorems)!

This document is an attempt to collate the various notes I took, proofs I annotated, applications I worked through into a single document. Each chapter provides some intuitive explanation of the theorem and related concepts, work throughs and explanations of the underlying proofs and, when relevant, examples from the applied literature. I have taken some liberties in doing so -- for instance combining Wooldridge's first two points into a single note on 'Expectation Theorems', and often omit continuous proofs where discrete proofs are similar and easier to follow. That said, I have tried to be reasonably exhaustive in my proofs so that they are accessible to those (like me) without a formal statistics background.

Most of the applied examples (and invisible corrections to my maths) stem from discussions with Andy Eggers and Musashi Harukawa. There will inevitably still be errors, omissions, and confusions passages within this document, and I would be more than grateful to receive any feedback at <thomas.robinson@politics.ox.ac.uk> or via the [GitHub repo for this project](github.com/tsrobinson/10EconTheorems).

### Prerequisites {-}

I worked through these proofs learning the bits of maths I needed as I went along. For those who want to consult Google a little less than I had to, the following should ease you into the more formal aspects of this document: 

* A simple working knowledge of probability theory

* The basics of expectation notation, but you don't need to know any expectation rules (I cover the important ones in [Chapter 1](#exp_theorems)). 

* A basic understanding of linear algebra (i.e. how you multiply matrices, what transposition is, and what the identity matrix looks like). More complicated aspects like eigenvalues and Gaussian elimination make fleeting appearances, particularly in [Chapter 9](#pd), but these are not crucial.

* Where relevant, I provide coded examples in R. I've kept my use of packages to a minimum so the code should be reasonably easy to read/port to other programming languages.
